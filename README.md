# Handy scripts for linux users
## Done and tested on Ubuntu 20.04

This repository contains scripts for Linux operating systems, but most likely will not work on all of them. The deeper idea of this repository is for me to get used to the C++ language.

### Contents
- `README.md`: This readme document.
- `config`: Configuration file mostly for file names and file paths.
- `init.cpp`: Source code of the initialization executable.
- `init`: Initialization executable, which handles the compilation of .cpp files in `src/` directory, and modification of alias file.

### Usage
Compile `init.cpp` or run `init` if you trust it. Afterwards new aliases are added for you to use.
